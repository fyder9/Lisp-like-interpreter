# Lisp-like-interpreter
Lisp-like language interpreter, written in java.

Usage: the program takes a file as an argument at the time of te execution, let's say from terminal (write: java Main.java test.txt)
it will check the sintax and it will execute the program right away if it has no errors, instead it stops and send the type of error 
wich has occurred and the line.

There's a directory full of test files you can run, (each test has either to fail or succed).
